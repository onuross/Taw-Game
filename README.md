# Taw Weight Comparison Program

This Python program is designed to analyze a series of boxes, each containing a specified number of taws with different weights. The goal is to identify manufacturing defects, specifically detecting boxes with unevenly weighted taws.

## Program Overview

The program prompts the user to input the number of taws in a box and the weight of three representative taws. Based on these inputs, it then categorizes the box into different types:

- **Returned Boxes**: Boxes where all three taws have distinct weights.
- **Heavier Boxes**: Boxes where one taw is heavier than the others.
- **Lighter Boxes**: Boxes where one taw is lighter than the others.
- **Equal Weight Boxes**: Boxes where all taws have the same weight.

## User Interaction

The user is prompted to provide input for each box, including the number of taws, the weights of three representative taws, and additional weights for the remaining taws if necessary.

## Results

After processing all boxes, the program provides detailed results, including:

- Number and percentage of boxes with manufacturing defects.
- Number of returned taws.
- Number of boxes with equal, heavier, and lighter taws.
- Average weight differences between heavier and normal taws, as well as lighter and normal taws.
- Percentage of weight differences for both heavier and lighter taws.
- Details about the box with the highest equal taw number and its weight.
- Details about the equal-weighted box with the heaviest taws.
- Biggest and smallest weight differences between two taws in a box, including percentage differences.

## Program Finish

The program concludes by displaying the results and statistics.
